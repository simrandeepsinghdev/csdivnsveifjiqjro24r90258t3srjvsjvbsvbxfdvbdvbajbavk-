This project focuses on identifying, regularizing, and enhancing various types of curves. The principal challenge is divided into the following sections:

Regularize Curves: Detect and standardize regular shapes within a given set of curves. This involves identifying and regularizing:

Straight Lines
Circles and Ellipses
Rectangles and Rounded Rectangles
Regular Polygons
Star Shapes
Explore Symmetry in Curves: Analyze curves for lines of symmetry, determining where the shape can be divided into mirrored halves to achieve reflection symmetry.

Complete Incomplete Curves: Address gaps or partial holes in planarized 2D curves, where overlapping portions have been removed. The goal is to naturally complete these curves.
